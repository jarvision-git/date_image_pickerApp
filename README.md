# date_image_pickerApp

I have developed this app with the specific goal of implementing date and photo picker functionality.


The date picker functionality allows users to select any date they desire. This includes the ability to choose past, present, or future dates depending on the task or purpose at hand. By incorporating a date picker, the app empowers users to conveniently interact with and manage date-related information.


On the other hand, the photo picker functionality enables users to select an image from their device's gallery. This feature provides a secure and controlled way for users to grant the app access to only the selected images and videos. By utilizing the photo picker, users can easily upload or associate images with various tasks or functionalities within the app, without granting access to their entire media library.
